If we're just riffing on this, I'd like to have a cli tool that works like:
npm installable
keep saved requests in a human-readable format in a directory, one per file, and can be parameterized and parameters provided on command line tool
works like imaginary-tool foobar --user 1 would run request in foobar.txt (or whatever format) and fill in template paremeter {user}
can make requests httpie/curl style just on the cli and then --save to imaginary-tool file format for later use
